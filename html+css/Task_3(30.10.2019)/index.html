                The Witcher (Polish: Wiedźmin)<wbr>, by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski, is a fantasy series of short 
                stories and novels about the witcher Geralt of Rivia. In Sapkowski's books, "witchers" are monster hunters 
                who (with training and body modification) develop supernatural abilities at a young age to battle deadly beasts. 
                The books have been adapted into a film, a television series, video games, and a graphic novel series.  
                The Witcher short stories were first published in Fantastyka, a Polish science fiction and fantasy magazine, 
                beginning in the mid-1980s. The first short story, "Wiedźmin" ("The Witcher") (1986), was written for a contest 
                held by the magazine and won third place. The first four stories dealing with the witcher Geralt were originally 
                featured in a 1990 short-story collection entitled Wiedźmin—now out of print—with "Droga, z której się nie wraca" 
                ("The Road With No Return"), which is set in the world before the Witcher stories and features Geralt's mother to be.

            <p class="bck-description flex-item">The stories are set on the Continent, which was settled several thousand years earlier by elves from overseas. When they arrived, the elves encountered gnomes and dwarves. After a period of war between the elves and dwarves, the dwarves retreated into the mountains and the elves settled in the plains and forests. Human colonists arrived about five hundred years before the events in the stories, igniting a series of wars. The humans were victorious, and became dominant; the non-human races, now considered second-class citizens, often live in small ghettos within human settlements. Those not confined to the ghettos live in wilderness regions not yet claimed by humans. Other races on the Continent are halflings and dryads; werewolves and vampires appeared after a magical event, known as the Conjunction of the Spheres. During the centuries preceding the stories, most of the Continent's southern regions have been taken over by the Nilfgaard Empire; the north belongs to the fragmented Northern Kingdoms. The Witcher saga takes place in the aftermath of the first major war between the Nilfgaard Empire and the Northern Kingdoms, with a second war beginning in the middle of the series.</p>

                The Continent can be divided into four regions. The Northern Kingdoms (where most of the saga takes place) consists of Aedirn, Cidaris, Cintra, Hengfors League, Kaedwen, Kerack, Kovir and Poviss, Lyria and Rivia, Redania, Temeria and Verden and several minor duchies and principalities such as Bremervoord or Ellander. The Nilfgaard Empire occupies most of the area south of the Northern Kingdoms. The eastern part of the Continent, such as the Korath desert, Zerrikania, Hakland and the Fiery Mountains, is mostly unknown. The book series mentions overseas countries with whom the Northern Kingdoms trade, including Zangvebar, Ofir, Hannu and Barsa.

                <p class="flex-item video-games-text">In 1996 and 1997 a Witcher video game was being developed by Metropolis Software in Poland, but it was cancelled. The game's director was Adrian Chmielarz, former People Can Fly co-owner and creative director, who coined the translation "The Witcher" during its development. According to Chmielarz, the game would have been a 3D action-adventure game with role-playing elements such as moral choices and experience points. The Witcher: Crimson Trail (Polish: Wiedźmin: Krwawy Szlak), also known as The Witcher Mobile is a mobile-phone action game created by Breakpoint on license from CD Projekt in November 2007. It features a young Geralt as a promising student who has completed his training to become a monster-slayer – a witcher.</p>
